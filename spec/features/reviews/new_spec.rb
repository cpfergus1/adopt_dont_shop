As a visitor,
When I visit a shelter's show page
I see a link to add a new review for this shelter.
When I click on this link, I am taken to a new review path
On this new page, I see a form where I must enter:
- title
- rating
- content
- the name of a user that exists in the database
I also see a field where I can enter an optional image (web address)
When the form is submitted, I should return to that shelter's show page
and I can see my new review
